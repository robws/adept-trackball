# Appendix C: Hardware

# Buying hardware from us

Getting all of the hardware on your own can be tricky because the parts you select may not fit perfectly. [That's why we sell kits with everything you need to build a Ploopy Adept Trackball](https://ploopy.co/product-category/trackball/adept/). Here's why that's great for you:

- Everything is guaranteed to fit together perfectly
- Everything is guaranteed to work as intended
- You'll end up saving money - probably quite a bit of money - by not spending on extra parts

Your call. You'll sort it out.

# Getting your own hardware

This guide was a bit light on detail in the other sections, and that's because the hardware has to conform to many specifications. They'll all be listed here.

First, a complete list of all the hardware you'll need:

- 4x Small Screws
- 3x MR63ZZ Roller Bearings
- 4x Friction Pads
- 1x Snooker Ball

We'll be going over all of them in detail. There will be mentions of *critical specifications*; if you're going to be sourcing your own parts, **you must get parts that conform to the critical specifications**. If you go off-menu, the parts will not fit the way that we intended when we designed the trackball. That might mean that your trackball **doesn't work**.

Let's get cracking.

## Small Screws

Here are the critical specifications:

- \#2
- 3/8" length

## MR63ZZ Roller Bearings
